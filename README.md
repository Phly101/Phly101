### 👋 About Me

I’m a **senior college student** and **Junior Flutter Developer** with hands-on experience in both leadership and development roles.

I’ve led a team of developers during an internship at **DEPI**, where I was responsible for coordination, technical direction, and delivery. I also serve as the **team lead for my graduation project**, managing both the technical and organizational aspects of the work.

Beyond academic and internship experience, I’ve completed **freelancing projects**, working directly with clients to deliver functional and well-designed applications.

I have a strong interest in **UI/UX design** and enjoy building clean, intuitive interfaces. My skill set includes designing and implementing user interfaces using **Flutter**, as well as creating **design systems and prototypes with Figma**, ensuring a smooth transition from design to code.
